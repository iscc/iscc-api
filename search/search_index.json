If metadata is set to a string it is assumed that it is base64 encoded binary file metadata. redirect # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#redirect URL to which a resolver should redirect an ISCC-ID that has been minted from a declartion that includes the IPFS-hash of this metadata instance. previous # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#previous ISCC of the preceding version of this item. filename # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#filename Filename of the referenced digital content (automatically used as fallback if the name field was not specified for ISCC processing) fps # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#fps Frames per second of video assets. width # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#width Width of visual media in number of pixels. height # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#height Height of visual media in number of pixels. characters # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#characters Number of text characters (code points after Unicode normalization) parts # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#parts Indicates items that are part of this item via Content-Codes (inverse-property belongs). part_of # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#part_of Indicates that this item is part of other items via their Content-Code. features # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#features Granular features of the digital content . generator # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#generator Name and version of the software that generated the ISCC external_url # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#external_url This is the URL that will appear below the asset's image on some NFT Marketplaces and will allow users to leave the site and view the item on your site. animation_url # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#animation_url A URL to a multi-media attachment for the item. properties # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#properties Descriptive, industry-sector or use-case specific metadata. Can be any object that is JSON/JCS serializable. If properties are provided they are the sole input for the cryptographic metahash calculation. Also compatible with ERC-1155 . If properties is set to a string it is assumed that it is base64 encoded binary file metadata. tophash # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#tophash A Multihash of the concatenation (binding) of metahash and datahash (default blake3). metahash # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#metahash A Multihash of the supplied metadata (default blake3). The hash is created from name and description fields or properties if supplied. For deterministic results JSC RFC5452 canonicalization is applied to properties before hashing if it is a JSON object. datahash # http://purl.org/iscc/terms/#datahash A Multihash of the digital content (default blake3).","title":"Terms"},{"location":"terms/#iscc-terms","text":"","title":"ISCC Terms"},{"location":"terms/#mapped-terms","text":"The following terms used in the ISCC metadata vocabulary are mapped to their https://schema.org equivalents.
